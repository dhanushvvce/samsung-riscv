![Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c766d4c-65ed-44d8-8b0b-a8b40a8989a1)  

## 📌 Overview  

The **Intruder Detection System** is a **real-time security solution** that detects unauthorized movement using an **Infrared (IR) sensor** and processes signals with the **VSDSquadron Mini FPGA board**. Upon detecting an intruder, the system **triggers an alert mechanism** such as a buzzer or LED.  

This project provides an **efficient, scalable, and cost-effective security solution** that can be further enhanced with **wireless communication, AI-based recognition, and cloud integration**.
