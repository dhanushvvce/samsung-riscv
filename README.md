## üõ†Ô∏è **Snapshots Description**

### üñ•Ô∏è **1. Assembly-Level Debugging Snapshot**
- **Description:** Analysis of low-level assembly instructions from a compiled program.
- **Key Focus:**
   - Register-level operations.
   - Memory address references.
   - Function call traces.
- **Purpose:** Understand how high-level C code maps to machine instructions.

---

### üìù **2. C Program Snapshot**
- **Description:** Simple C program to calculate the **sum of numbers from 1 to n** using a loop.
- **Key Focus:**
   - Syntax and logic analysis.
   - Debugging `printf` statements.
   - Correct usage of loops.
- **Purpose:** Identify and resolve logical and syntactical errors in the C code.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **3. Assembly Disassembly Snapshot**
- **Description:** Detailed disassembly of the **main function** in an executable.
- **Key Focus:**
   - Conditional branching.
   - Stack and heap memory operations.
   - Instruction-level execution.

##    TASK 2,RISC V

This task involves comparing two optimization levels, -O1 and -Ofast, while debugging a simple C program using SPIKE.

The compiled C code

The -O1 optimization option provides moderate optimization to balance performance and compilation time. It's ideal for a blend of performance improvements without heavily impacting the debugging process. On the other hand, -Ofast optimizes aggressively for maximum performance, even at the cost of adherence to some standard-compliant behaviors and potentially more challenging debugging.

The provided file contains the code subject to these optimizations.

The RISC-V object dump for each optimization level (-O1 and -Ofast).

The riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump command disassembles the object file, providing insight into the machine code generated by each optimization level:

The provided file contains the code subject to these optimizations.
